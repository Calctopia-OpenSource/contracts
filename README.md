Preliminary versions of token smart contracts (RAZ token)

 - ERC20 tokens that are pausable and upgradeable
 - the number and price of the tokens for each tokenholder is set by the deployer after a truthful Vickrey-Dutch auction, as described on the paper [An Optimal ICO Mechanism](https://github.com/Calctopia-OpenSource/documentation/blob/master/An%20Optimal%20ICO%20Mechanism.pdf)
 - two versions available: tokens packaged with callable warrants, or with detachable callable warrants (so they can be listed on separate exchanges)
